                  <h1>Gym Knight</h1>
                  <p>This game is about a bug gym knight that loses his protien and must reclaim or find protein powder. Thos game is a side scrolling platformer with a buff knight collecting various flavors of protein. He does what it takes using his trusty barbell and his muscles to get through and persevere for protein.
                    The player will be able to control the character using the WASD keys and jump using the spacebar. 
                    They can also press J to use a melee weapon.
                    The player goes through a brief tutorial section explaining the controls and the premise of the game. 
                    They then go through a series of levels with platforming and enemies in order to collect the Protein Jar at the end of the game. 
                    There will be collectibles/items to help the player on their journey, but they are not required to complete the game.

              <p> The game I decided to play was Dragon Ball Z 2 - Super Battle. As I was browsing it caught my eye because I'm a fan of Dragon Ball Z so I decided to pick that game to try. Knowing that the game was originally an arcade game I didn’t realize how weird and awkward it was with the control mapping to play the game. Other than that it was a fun experience. The game was released in 1994 so it was fun to see how far the new Dragon Ball fighting games came. There wasn’t a lot to the game in terms of learning how to play. It just gave you the controls and put you in there. Jumping right into it I lost to this 1994 computer AI but after getting used to it and learning how to play Gohan and use the combo I slowly got the hang of it. But in truth, I felt like I was just mashing buttons and not really throwing combos correctly. </p>

            <p> The atmosphere I think is different. I remember the arcades back when I was a kid was always so flashy and full of noise so that ambients I think played an important role in my joy. I knew I was sucked into the game when all the noise just seemly cut out as I hyperfocused on a game. Playing at home on an emulator gave me a different feeling. It was less distracting and playing on a keyboard what I’ve been used to is not actually hard to adapt and overcome. </p>

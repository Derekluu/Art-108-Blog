                    There are many things I have learned taking this class. There are many aspects to video games that I did not actively recgonize. As someone who has played many games
                    It was of great interest to learn more indepth process of making and designing a game. It takes a lot of steps, trial and error to push out a product that
                    combines so many different elements together. I found it fascinating that games have, art, writing, music, sound, coding, and much more so learning on the aspects
                    more in depth was a lesson well learnt. I think there wasn't one thing i found most interesting but just the process I found so captivating. The materiels I thought connected very well together
                    and I read about, wrote about, played, and designed games in this class. I will continue to learn and although being a game designer does seem like an impossible job I think doing it on the side would be wonderful.

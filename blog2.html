            <p>For this blog we played a game called cheat. It is a fun game that involves cards and lying. Players must play cards in order of Ace to King or choose to lie about the card in play. Through out the session report it is listed the quanity of a certain card played and times players doubted a play.</p>

            <p>  Dzuy won </p>
            <p> As you can see the players once they got comfortable and stared to figure out what cards are being placed down gained confidence to start doubting other players. Most of the doubts were indeed wrong but when players weren't wrong the reward seemed great. I think it is more interesting to see the cards pile up and realizing that doubting a play was a very fun move.</p>
